⚔️ Chronicles of the Base Empire:
The Sprint of the Samurai
Samurai Frenchie
Nov 12, 2025
The morning after the great battle, silence blanketed the fields of the Base Empire. Smoke coiled around fallen banners, and the red sun hung low — a witness to both glory and loss.

From the ashes, only one Frog Ninja remained. Cloaked in black, with a red scarf torn and stained, he darted across the open plain — the last shadow of rebellion. Behind him thundered the steps of the Samurai Frenchie’s, blades flashing in the sun, armor ringing like the heartbeat of the empire itself.

They did not chase for vengeance.
They chased for order — for the code that bound every warrior of Base.

As the Frog slipped into the mist, the lead Samurai Frenchie raised his sword to the horizon. “Even a single shadow can darken an empire,” he said. “So we chase the sun — until all is light again.”

And thus, the tale of The Sprint of the Samurai was etched into legend — not as a hunt, but as a reminder:
Honor moves faster than fear.
