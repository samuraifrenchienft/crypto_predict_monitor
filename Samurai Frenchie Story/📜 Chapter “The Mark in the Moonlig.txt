📜 Chapter: “The Mark in the Moonlight”

The air in the bamboo forest tightened —
even the wind seemed afraid to make a sound.

Raijin crouched low, dual kodachi glimmering with the moon’s reflection.
He followed tracks only his trained eye could see —
a single figure, injured but fighting to survive.

Snapped bamboo.
A streak of blood.
Claw marks… wide and deep.

Not serpent.

Someone strong.

He pressed forward, instincts razor-sharp.
A faint metallic scent drew him to a clearing, where the moon spilled silver across the dirt.

There — half buried in the soil —
was a piece of armor.

Raijin paused.

Slowly he lifted it into the light.

A square.
Deep blue.
Carved with heritage older than his own memory.

The symbol of a clan believed long extinct…

The House of the Crescent Fang.
Kage’s clan.

His pulse — normally steady — stumbled in his chest.

He whispered:

“Another survivor…”

But before relief could settle —

HSSSSSSSHK!

A serpent blade slashed out of the darkness.
Raijin spun, steel hissing free.
Eyes burned bright blue.

Dozens of Serpent ninjas slithered into view —
closing off every escape.

The commander emerged last — towering, venom dripping from his fangs.

“Step away from the relic, pup.”

Raijin stood firm, blade raised, the relic clutched behind him.

“I protect what the moon reveals.”
“Strike… and you face the Silent Lightning.”

The bamboo bent.
The moon blazed.

And lightning was about to fall.
