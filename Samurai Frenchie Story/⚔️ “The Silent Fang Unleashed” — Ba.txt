⚔️ “The Silent Fang Unleashed” — Battle of the Red Mist
The forest outside Edo was unnaturally still. Even the wind refused to speak as Kage stepped into the clearing, his armor glinting with the first red light of dawn. A thin mist hugged the ground, glowing like spilled blood beneath the rising sun.

He wasn’t alone.

Dozens of Frog Ninjas emerged from the trees—silent, masked, their black-and-red garments shifting like shadows. In the center stood their general, a towering figure with crimson markings and eyes that flickered like dying embers.

This was the one.
The architect of Kage’s past.
The ghost he had chased his entire life.

The general croaked a harsh command.

The clearing exploded into motion.

Kage drew his katana in a single, practiced arc—shffft—edge catching the light as he slipped into Hibiki-no-Inu, the Echoing Dog stance. His paws hit the ground with controlled rhythm, each step a note in a deadly symphony.

The first Frog Ninja lunged.

Kage pivoted, blade flashing—one strike, clean and precise. The frog fell before its feet even touched the earth again.

Another.
Then two more.

They descended on him from every direction, a swarm of blades and poison-tipped darts. But Kage moved like a ghost in a storm—low, fast, silent. His armor rattled softly, like the warning of a distant drum.

Steel rang.
Bodies dropped.
Crimson stained the mist.

But still they came.

A spinning chain-sickle tore through the air toward him—Kage ducked, rolled, and slashed upward, catching the wielder across the chest. He rose into a perfect stance, breath steady, eyes locked on the general.

The general stepped forward at last, drawing two jagged tantos.
“Your clan dies with you,” he hissed.

Kage tightened his grip.
“No,” he whispered.
“It lives through me.”

They clashed.

Metal screamed as the general struck with savage fury—slashes, jabs, spinning cuts meant to overwhelm. Kage parried each with disciplined precision, the rhythm of his master’s teachings echoing through every movement.

A miss.
A counter.
A spark of steel.

The general lunged for a finishing strike—

Kage sidestepped.

In one sweeping motion, he drew a final arc across the general’s chest. The world froze. The mist settled. The general collapsed to the earth, defeated at last.

Kage exhaled.

The forest fell quiet again, the ghosts of his past finally laid to rest. He sheathed his katana at his hip, the sound soft but final.

The Silent Fang had won.
And Edo would never forget the morning the mist turned red.
