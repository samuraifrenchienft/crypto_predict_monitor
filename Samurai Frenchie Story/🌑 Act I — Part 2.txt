🌑 Act I — Part 2
Chapter: “Call of the Shadow Litter”
The drums sounded again.
Low… heavy… ancient.

Below the War Hall, gears shifted inside the stone walls — a mechanism not used in years.

A hidden floor split open, revealing a shaft descending into darkness.

Blue fox-fire lanterns flickered to life along a spiral staircase.

Raiju cracked his knuckles.



“Haven’t heard that since… well… ever.”

They descended into the Core Chamber — an underground sanctum carved from the oldest rock of the Base House.

The torchlight dimmed.
Silhouettes stirred.

Three wolves stood waiting — masked, armored, disciplined.

The rest of the Shadow Litter.

Raijin lifted his blades.



“War has found us again.”

Raiju’s voice rumbled like thunder:



“It’s time we return the favor.”

The five wolves bowed their heads in unison.

Shadow Litter — Deploy.
