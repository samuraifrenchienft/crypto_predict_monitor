📜 “The Silent Fang of Edo” 📜
At the break of dawn in Old Edo, when the fog draped itself over the rooftops and the world stood quiet between breaths, a lone warrior walked the empty roads. His name was Kage, known throughout whispered tavern tales as The Silent Fang.

His armor, weathered but unbroken, carried the legacy of a fallen clan wiped out by treacherous Pepe Clan Ninjas many seasons ago. Kage had been the only survivor—pulled from the ruins by an elderly swordsmith who raised him with discipline, honor, and the unforgiving code of Bushidō.

Under the swordsmith’s guidance, he mastered Hibiki-no-Inu, the Echoing Dog style—a swift, rhythmic technique built on precision and relentless pursuit. Kage wore his katana properly at his left hip, edge-up, tied securely into his obi. It was the last remaining heirloom of his bloodline.

For years he moved silently across provinces, chasing rumors, following footprints in the night, hunting the secretive Pepe Ninja clans responsible for his family’s end. Wherever he appeared, justice followed. Wherever he vanished, legends grew.

Now, the Pepe General — the architect of his clan’s downfall—has been sighted once more. The trail is fresh. The moment has come.

As the morning sun rises behind him, lighting the golden crescent atop his kabuto, Kage rests his paw on the hilt of his sword. His breath is calm. His resolve is absolute.

Today, the hunter completes his path.

Today, the Silent Fang rises.
