⚜️Shadow Litter - Act ll⚜️
Chapter: “Whispers in the Reeds”



Night clung to the marshlands like a wet shroud.



Thick reeds swayed in the cold wind, hissing softly as Hayate slipped silently along the water’s edge — his pawsteps so light they barely kissed the earth.



His wolf-keen eyes scanned the horizon.

His breathing — controlled.

His longbow — already drawn.



A faint shimmer reflected off the pools of dark water.



Movement.



But not serpent.



Small. Agile. Slime-slick figures leaping between lily pads.



Frog Ninjas.



Once a minor irritation in the underworld of Edo…

now armed, armored, and — most concerning —



marching under Serpent Clan banners.



Hayate narrowed his eyes.



He could see the “welcoming party”…



A serpent emissary

exchanging scrolls and weapons

with frog assassins



The frogs croaked out quiet laughs, brandishing new venom-coated steel.

The serpents bowed with a smug, coiled confidence.



It was a deal sealed in shadows.



Hayate muttered under his breath:



“Trouble compounds…”



His bowstring tightened.



He could end the emissary here.

One arrow.

One perfect shot.



But then he saw it —

a sigil stamped on the scrolls:



the Crescent Fang

Kage’s mark



This wasn’t a trade.

It was a hunt contract.



Hayate’s heart hammered once —

like a war drum.



The frogs and serpents were forming a coalition to capture the last heir of the Crescent clan.



He pulled out a data-dart — a glowing marker Tekka invented — and fired it into the sky:



PING.



A brilliant blue starburst shimmered above the marsh — invisible to normal eyes…



but clear as a howl to wolves of the Shadow Litter.



Hayate slid back into the reeds, whispering:



“If they think we run…

they don’t know wolves.”



The hunt had officially begun —

and the next blood spilled…

would not be theirs.
