📜 Chapter: “Break the Circle”

Serpent blades struck from every side —
but Raiju stood like a fortress, kanabo buried in the earth.

His voice boomed:

“You want him…”
he pointed his clawed gauntlet toward Raijin
“…you go through me.”

The serpents hesitated.
For the first time… they feared.

Raijin staggered up, catching his breath, blood on his armor —
still staring at the stolen emblem clutched in a serpent commander’s hand.

He knew what it meant.

If they lost that relic,
the last evidence of Kage’s clan would disappear into the shadows forever.

Raiju leaned in close, without taking his eyes off the enemy:

“Brother… call it.”

Raijin lifted his blades — eyes glowing brighter than the moon.

“Thunder Claw…
break the circle.”

With a roar that shook the bamboo,
Raiju slammed his kanabo into the ground—

The forest erupted.
Soil exploded.
Serpents were launched into the air like leaves in a storm.

Raijin grabbed Raiju’s arm as the dust swallowed the clearing.

“Move!”
Raijin sprinted — Raiju behind him, crushing any serpent who dared rise.

Arrows flew — Raijin sliced them midair.
A serpent leapt — Raiju backhanded him into a tree.

The emblem was still in enemy hands…
but they had precious seconds.

The moon guided them through the bamboo
toward the only safe light left in the world:

The Base House.

The Shadow Litter had officially entered the war.
