⚔️ Chapter: “When Shadows Howl”

Steel flashed like lightning through bamboo.

Raijin parried one strike — then another — then three more.
Every movement perfect.
Every breath calculated.

But there were too many.

Serpent warriors filled the clearing, circling tighter with each passing second. Their blades dripped venom, tips glinting as they closed in.

A commander hissed:

“You are alone, wolf.
Your House is dead in the dirt.”

Raijin wiped blood from his jaw — not his.
He kept his stance low, kodachi crossed in defiance.

“Dead things don’t bleed.”

They rushed him.

He struck first — lightning reflex, moonlight slicing air.
Two fell. Then a third.

But a curved blade hooked into his armor — pulling him off balance.
Another slammed into his ribs
and forced him to a knee.

A serpent ninja grabbed the relic plate —
Kage’s emblem —
from Raijin’s grasp
“He dies not knowing why…”
the commander laughed.

The blade lifted.
The bamboo wind stopped.

Raijin growled — not in fear
but in refusal.

Just before the killing strike—

A BOOM — like a thunderclap — crashed through the trees.

A giant silhouette tore through the bamboo wall
sending splinters flying and serpent warriors tumbling like leaves.

Heavy footsteps.
Slow. Purposeful.

A deep voice — like distant thunder:

“He does not…
kneel alone.”

The serpents froze.

Raijin smirked — relief in his eyes for the first time.

He knew that voice.
