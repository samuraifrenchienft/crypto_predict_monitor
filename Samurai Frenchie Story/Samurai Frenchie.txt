Samurai Frenchie
📜 Shadow Litter — Act II
The gates of the Base House loomed tall and silent, lit only by lanterns swaying in the late-night wind. The guards stiffened as two wolves burst from the bamboo tree line — armor battered, paws blood-stained, arrows clattering behind them.

Raijin didn’t slow.

“We need the War Master — now!” he barked as he sprinted through the entrance.

Raiju thundered after him, ears pinned back, still scanning the shadows behind them for serpents.

Inside the outer courtyard, warriors rushed to help — but one look at Raiju’s glare, and they kept their distance. He wasn’t done being dangerous.

They passed the training yards, the pigeon towers, the inner gate… and at last reached the War Hall.

There, beneath towering banners of the Base House, stood Master Byakko — a scarred arctic wolf, white armor gleaming.

Raijin dropped to a knee.

“Master… the Serpent Clan is not only alive — they’re hunting survivors of the Crescent Fang.”

He opened his paw, revealing a shredded strip of blue armor — Kage’s clan symbol — taken from a serpent scout before the escape.

Byakko’s eyes widened.
A ghost from history had resurfaced.

Raiju lowered his voice, rumbling like distant thunder:

“They have the relic.
And they know someone else survived.”

The hall fell silent.

Master Byakko turned to the massive war map carved into the wall — pulsing with dim blue crystals marking their intelligence.

“If the Serpent Clan knows of the survivor… they will strike again.”

Raijin stood, voice steady:

“Then we strike first.”

Byakko nodded once.

“It’s time to wake the others.”

The torches dimmed as a lone drum sounded in the depths of the Base House.

Shadow Litter — Destroy them All.
